- question: 'Where would you place yourself on this ladder?

Think of a ladder representing where people stand in your country.

At the top of the ladder are the people who are the best off - those who have the most money, the most education and the most respected jobs. At the bottom are the people who are the worst off - who have the least money, least education, and the least respected jobs or no job. The higher up you are on the ladder, the closer you are to the people at the very top; the lower you are the closer you are to people at the very bottom.'
