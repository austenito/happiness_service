# Happiness Service

An open source server implementation of [Track Your Happiness](https://www.trackyourhappiness.org), which allows you to answer [questions](https://github.com/austenito/happiness/blob/master/QUESTIONS.md) and store your responses.

The impetus of this project is around privacy and limited sharing. I want confidence my data is stored in a safely and I want to be able to expose certain aspects of myself to others. I also wanted to have the ability to control what questions I answer and how many questions I answer.

A big problem I find with Track Your Happiness are:

* questions to answer - I don't like answering more than 5 questions
* general questions - I want to answer questions that are specific to me
* survey length - I wish the survey lasted for longer than 6 weeks. I want a total picture of my happiness over a long period of time.

# Setup

```
bundle
rake db:create db:migrate db:seed db:test:prepare
rspec
```

# Questions

All questions have been duplicated from Track Your Happiness. They can be found [here](https://github.com/austenito/happiness_service/blob/master/config/questions.yml)

Questions are simple and general. They have the following schema:

* question text
* type (multiple, boolean, time, range)
* freeform (boolean)
* min and max
